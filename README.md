# 🔁 IT Audit Portfolio – Change Management Controls (Critical Production System)

> 📌 SOX-aligned IT audit simulation focused on change control risks in a live production ERP environment. Includes findings on missing change artifacts, late approvals, and control gaps that could affect production stability.

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary

- ✅ 10 change controls tested in a **critical production ERP system**
- ❌ Missing: Authorization Tickets, Test Plan Docs, Approval Emails
- ⚠️ Risk of untested or unauthorized changes reaching production
- 🛠️ Includes RCM, audit report, testing workbook, risk matrix

---

## 🎯 Scope & Objectives

**System Audited:** Live ERP Production Environment  
**Audit Period:** Jan 2025 – Oct 2025  

### Objectives:
- Evaluate change request approvals and authorization tracking
- Assess completeness of test evidence before go-live
- Validate backout plans and deployment documentation

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Reviewed change control policies & workflows  
- Walkthrough with release manager & change coordinator  
- Selected 10 production changes for test of operating effectiveness  
- Checked for ticket #, approval email, test plan, and deployment evidence

---

## 🚨 Key Findings

### 1. ❌ Missing Authorization Tickets  
- **Risk:** Unauthorized changes deployed to production  
- **Fix:** Make ticket entry mandatory before release

### 2. ❌ No Test Plan Documentation  
- **Risk:** Unvalidated code moved to live environment  
- **Fix:** Enforce upload of test plans in change record

### 3. ❌ Missing Approval Emails  
- **Risk:** No evidence of managerial sign-off  
- **Fix:** Require attached email or approval workflow record
